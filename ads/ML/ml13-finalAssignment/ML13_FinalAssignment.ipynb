    "+ What are the features and labels to start with, motivate your choices (e.g. based on literature).\n",
    "+ Make a description of the dataset.\n",
    "+ Find out which are the most important features, should you add and remove features?\n",
    "+ Show how far can you go with K-means clustering?\n",
    "+ Apply different classification algorithms, vary the values of the most important parameters, play with the number of features and keep records of algo scores. \n",
    "+ Motivate your choices, and of course, support your research journey with appealing and informative graphs and diagrams."
